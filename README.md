## Scenario
Scotland yard have intercepted information about one of the biggest drug deals to go down in the city of London. Someone we believe is linked to the deal was arrested. The only item they had in their possession was a USB thumb drive. Unfortunately, one of our junior analysts was unable to find anything of interest. Before we let this suspect go, we would like one of our DF experts to see if they can find anything about the deal before it goes down. Can you find out where and when the deal is expected to go down?
